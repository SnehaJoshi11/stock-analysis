# Stock-Analysis with VBA and Excel
## Overview : VBA Stock Analysis Project

We are analysing the yearly stock data to compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times 
of the original script and the refactored script.

## Purpose
<p>
Purpose of the this project was to refactor the VBA code to determine the stocks information of year 2017 and 2018 is worth to invest in it.
 
We have to analyse the data with the help of Exel and  VBA code.

Normally we analyse the data with the help of Excel but sometimes that could be time consuming.

So here we used VBA to analyse the given stock data by writing a subroutine "ALL Stocks Analysis" and " All Stocks Analysis Refactored".


1.Original Script "All stocks Analysis"
2.Refactored script 
</p>

##Analysis and Challenges

	1. Original Script "All stocks Analysis"

     <p>
	In "All Stocks Analysis" with the help of given process and examples(Using array, loops,timer,formmating data).
	  --We find out the stocks information accoring to year"2017" and"2018".
	  --With the help of setting timer,it shows how much time it required to run the process or code.
                   --Refer the below screen shot.

	2.Refactored script "All Stocks Analysis Refactored"

	<p> 
	
		--In "All Stocks Analysis Refactored",Goal was to refactor the code to increase the efficiency of the original code.
		--With the help of setting timer,it shows how much time it required to run the process or code.
		--Refer the below screen shot

## Challenges on Data Background

**DATA**
	 Given data was about 12 different stocks information having ticker value, date issued ,opening, closing and
	 adjusted closing price with highest and lowest price and their volumes.

## Analysis "Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, 
as well as the execution times of the original" 
script and the refactored script.

With the help of given steps, I tried to copy required data and write the code as per the requirements mentioned in the challenge.
	-Input box
	-Chart headers
	-Ticker array,
 	-Activate the worksheet
	-Timer
	<P>Here is some of the code which I was trying to refactor the data and 
	images to understand how refactoring increases the eficiency of the code.

## Summary : 

**Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**

Summary: 

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

<p>	You need to write the code which has small changes and efficiency 
	that would make your code better and in working mode.n basis of removing the  
</p>
<p>
 1.Advantages-
	-VBA interpretation (Excel) of code can reveal patterns that are not easy to see in the source.
	-Errores can easily appear in well structured code that conatains loops.

 2.Disadvantages-
	-It is time consuming.
	-You have to change the logic to eleminate the duplicate lines.
	-It can also affect thetesting outcomes.
	
</p>
 <p>                                  
 How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
	--It is the easy way to rearrange, restructure, and clarify existing code at the same time 
	  even not changing the behaviour of your code.
	

	--It also produces a healthier code base, making it more useable, readable,
 	   and maintainable for you or any other developerwho might using the code.

	-A clean and well-organized code is always easy to change, easy to understand, and easy to maintain.
	  You can avoid facing difficulty later if you pay attention to the code refactoring process earlier.
